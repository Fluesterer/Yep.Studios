    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a 12-year-old boy, and to be honest, I didn’t have the easiest childhood.
        At first, we seemed like a normal, happy family — at least that’s what I thought.
        But everything changed after we moved. My parents started fighting, even on my birthday.
        I remember a window breaking while I just sat there, confused and scared.
    </p>

    <p>
        The only one who was always there for me was my older brother. He meant the world to me.
        He understood me when no one else did. Even when I couldn’t sleep night after night,
        I still went to school like everything was fine. But it wasn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was getting bullied. No one noticed — not even the teachers. I felt invisible.
        My brother and I would go on long walks just to get away from the shouting at home.
        That’s when I discovered gaming. It became my escape.
        And then I found Roblox Studio — a way not just to play, but to create.
    </p>

    <p>
        That’s how Yep Studios was born. A place where I could build worlds better than the one I lived in.
        A place where I could feel safe, happy, and free.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm still dealing with things at home. The fights haven’t stopped. But creating games helps me breathe.
        It makes me feel like I have a voice — like I matter.
    </p>

    <p>
        So if you’re playing one of my games, just know: you're not just playing something random.
        You’re walking through the pieces of my story.
